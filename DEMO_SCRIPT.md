# UC Berkeley Endowment Demo Script (90 seconds)

**Audience:** Head of UC Berkeley Endowment  
**Goal:** Show how ARC accelerates PE diligence with institutional-grade alternative data

---

## **[0:00-0:15] OPENING – The Problem (15 sec)**

*Start on homepage*

> "Let me show you FEV's Alternatives AI Ready Catalog—**ARC**. When UC endowment evaluates PE investments, you need alternative data **fast**—FX exposure, company intelligence, real estate signals. But today, that data is siloed across vendors, slow to access, and hard to integrate into your models."

## **PRO TIPS FOR DELIVERY**

1. **Pace**: Speak confidently but not rushed—90 seconds is tight
2. **Mouse**: Hover deliberately—no erratic clicking
3. **Rehearse**: Run through 3x before the actual demo
4. **Fallback**: If a page loads slowly, say *"While this loads, note that..."* and keep talking
5. **End Strong**: Pause after the close, make eye contact, let them respond

## **BACKUP QUESTIONS & ANSWERS**

**Q: "Is this real data or a demo?"**  
A: "This is a demo environment with representative data structures. For production, we integrate your actual Neon database and licensed data feeds."

**Q: "How much does this cost?"**  
A: "ARC pricing is per-seat for data consumers, plus data provider licensing. For UC Berkeley's scale, we'd propose a pilot at [X seats] to validate ROI before full rollout."

**Q: "What about data security?"**  
A: "ARC runs on your infrastructure—Neon for storage, Vercel for frontend. All data access is logged and governed by your internal policies, which you saw in the 'Policies' section."

**Q: "Can we integrate our existing Bloomberg/FactSet?"**  
A: "Absolutely. ARC is designed to sit **alongside** your current stack—it's a discovery layer, not a replacement. We have connectors for Bloomberg, FactSet, Refinitiv, etc."

**Good luck! 🎯**
